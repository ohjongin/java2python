About
-----
This package provides tools to (imperfectly) translate java source
code to python source code.


Build
-----
To build the code, install Python_ 2.5 or newer, and install PyAntlr_.
Then run "make" in the top of the package.

.. _Python: http://www.python.org/
.. _PyAntlr: http://www.antlr.org/


Install
-------

To install the package and the scripts into your system, then as the super user, run:

    $ python setup.py install

The setup script will install the java2python package in
$PYTHONHOME/site-packages, and install the scripts into a bin
directory.


Use
---
To use the "java_to_python" script, either make and install the
package (as per above), or adjust PYTHONPATH (and possibly PATH) to
include the source directories.  Then run the script like so:

    $ java_to_python -i input_file.java -o output_file.py

The script has configuration options that you can view:

    $ java_to_python -h
